	You know I use to be your age, but that was a long time ago. Anyways, this is YOUR &#x1FAF5; birthday &#x1F382; web page. I hope you enjoy it as much as Al Roker enjoys watching you sleep at night.

	I didn't get you any cash &#x1F4B8; or gifts &#x1F381;, so you're just going to have to accept this page and be happy with it
